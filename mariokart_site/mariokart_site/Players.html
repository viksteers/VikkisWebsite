						Mario is a character created by Japanese video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto.
						He is the title character of the Mario franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company
						Nintendo.
						Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy,
						Italian plumber who resides in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center on rescuing
						Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has access to a variety of power-ups that
						give him different abilities. Mario's fraternal twin brother is Luigi.<br /><br>

						the primary antagonist in Nintendo's Mario franchise, and the arch-nemesis of Mario.
						In Japan, the character bears the title of Daimaō (大魔王, "Great Demon King").
						Bowser is the leader of the turtle-like Koopa race. His ultimate goals are to kidnap Princess
						Peach
